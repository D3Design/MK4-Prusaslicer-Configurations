Here's a configuration I made and has been thoroughly tested with PLA, and if you increase the hotend temperature it also works well for PETG. It is faster and prints higher quality than the standard settings. The stock settings limit hotend flow to 15mm^3/s, but I have found that PLA at 225 is capable of 20-22mm^3/s with the stock Prusa Nextruder and 0.4mm Nozzle.

To import the configuration, install the updated version of prusaslicer from here: https://www.prusa3d.com/en/page/prusaslicer_424/


Then go to file --> import --> import config and select the .ini file

If the configuration imports correctly, the top right of the page should look like this where all three say the same thing.

Happy Printing!
